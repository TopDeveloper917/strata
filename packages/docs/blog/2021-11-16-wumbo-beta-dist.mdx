# Wum.bo Beta Distribution

As we migrate the smart contracts supporting Wum.bo to Strata, Strata is taking over
the distribution of the Wum.bo beta prize pool. To learn more about Strata, read our [Welcome Post](/blog/welcome)

During the beta, you accumulated a Total Net Worth in bWUM. After the beta, a Net bWUM token was sent out that should be in your wallet.

You now have two options. You can either **exchange for SOL** now, or **hold on to your tokens** and wait for the launch of [the Open Collective](#the-open-collective), gaining an extra 10% of OPEN tokens.

## The Open Collective

The Open Collective is the first token that will be launched on Strata. It is the default token that Social Tokens will be bound to; like bWUM in the Wum.bo beta.
There are no fees or royalties on the Open Collective. It is bound to SOL, and is intended to create a base community on which users can align their Social Tokens.
In Strata, Social Tokens can be bound to any token, like SOL, USDC, or a new community token. This leaves flexibility for new business models, increased utility, and emergent phenomena.

Wum.bo will be using the Open Collective for all unclaimed tokens, and users that claim their tokens will default to the Open Collective. 
Collectives are fluid, users are able to leave to join different collectives. For more on collectives, you can read [Collectives](/docs/learn/collectives)

## OPEN tokens vs Exchange For SOL

OPEN will launch using the [Bonding Curve Fair Launch](/docs/learn/bonding_curves)

If you hold on to your Net bWUM, you'll be able to exchange them for **10% more** OPEN tokens than you could buy with the SOL you're getting back.

So, for example, if OPEN tokens are priced initially at 0.1 SOL/OPEN, and your Net bWUM entitles you to 1 SOL. You could either

   * Echange your Net bWUM for 1 SOL now
   * Exchange your Net bWUM for 11 OPEN Tokens
