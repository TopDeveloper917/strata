Strata is a protocol for Community driven Social Tokens, powered by [Solana](https://solana.com/). It is the fastest and least expensive way to create, manage, and build economies of Social Tokens

Strata is for builders and entrepreneurs, providing primitives to launch their own token-driven business models. 

The goal is simple: make it easier for talented people to work together on launching productive networks and communities. 
Strata Social Tokens empower the individual, while Strata Collectives make it possible to pool resources to build powerful shared incentive structures. This will fuel not just the Creator Economy, but a new
 **Cooperation Economy**.

## What is a Social Token?

Let’s start first with the definition of a Token:

  > A token is an object that represents something else, such as another object (either physical or virtual).

Tokens are easy to move around, track ownership, and impossible to fake. We can represent anything with a token, which allows people to freely move ownership in a convenient way. 

A Social Token is a Token associated with an individual. There are many flavors of Social Token, but typically they provide access, status, and utility with the individual they represent.

### Succeed Together

The power of a token is in shared ownership. All token holders are incentive aligned to drive value and utility for that token. A group of people can pool resources and bring about innovation on a larger scale.

## Tokens all the way down

A token can represent one community or individual; but what if we want to create a network of communities building towards a common goal?

At the heart of Strata are [Bonding Curves](/docs/learn/bonding_curves) that allow free and instant trading of a token without the need for an exchange or liquidity provider. 
This Automated Market Maker (AMM) ties your token's value directly to that of another token. Similar to how Poker Chips are directly tied to the underlying currency.

That underlying token is your *Collective*. Price your token in SOL, and you are now incentive aligned to increase the value of SOL. Your own success also pushes demand for SOL.

:::info Collective
A Collective is a group of Social Tokens bound to the same base token. Every token owner bound to the collective is incentive aligned to increase not just the value of their token, but the value of the Collective
:::

Imagine a group of artists forming a collective for their genre, pooling resources to create a custom marketplace.
Imagine a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a token, and a collective of contributors with tokens bound to the DAO token.
Imagine the ability to bootstrap an entire economy around an idea.

## From Creator Economy to Cooperation Economy

Strata isn't just about creating a new monetization layer for creators. Our mission is to see what we can all accomplish together. 

### Free and Open

The key to innovation is rapid iteration and exploration. We believe that taking a cut will stifle innovation. As such, Strata is completely free to use and Open Source. The smart contracts take no share of the tokens exchanged.

The goal is for the Strata Protocol to become a standard, similar to [Metaplex](https://metaplex.com/) for social tokens and bonding curves.

### BYOC - Build your own Community

Unlike other Social Tokens, we won't bind your token's value to the value of our own token.
If you have an idea and can rally a community behind it, create a Collective and drive your own utility.

### Flexibility with Sane Defaults

The most innovative business models have yet to be discovered.
As such, the protocol remains as non opinionated and flexible as possible. 

Powerful customization is at your fingertips. 
From a large degree of freedom in bonding curve customization to the ability to tie social tokens to virtually anything;
Strata is truly your canvas. You can customize everything from your curve's shape to its launch-time characteristics, to the royalties you collect.

This might sound complicated, but with sane defaults you don't have to reach under the hood. Don't believe us? Create a social token on devnet _right now_

```jsx async name=create_social
var { mint } = await tokenCollectiveSdk.createSocialToken({
  ignoreIfExists: true, // If a Social Token already exists for this wallet, ignore.
  metadata: {
    name: "Learning Strata Token",
    symbol: "luvSTRAT",
    uri: "https://strataprotocol.com/luvSTRAT.json",
  },
  tokenBondingParams: {
    buyBaseRoyaltyPercentage: 0,
    buyTargetRoyaltyPercentage: 10,
    sellBaseRoyaltyPercentage: 0,
    sellTargetRoyaltyPercentage: 0
  }
});
```
Now display it in React!
```jsx live
 function TokenDisplay() {
   const { mint } = useVariables(); // Getting mint from above
   const { image, metadata, loading: metaLoading } = useTokenMetadata(mint);
   if (metaLoading) {
     return <div>Loading...</div>
   }

   return <div>
    <img style={{ width: "50px", height: "50px" }} src={image} />
    { metadata && <div>
      <div><b>{metadata.data.name}</b></div>
      <div>{metadata.data.symbol}</div>
    </div> }
   </div>
 }
```
