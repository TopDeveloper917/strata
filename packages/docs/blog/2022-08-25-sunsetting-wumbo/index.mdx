# Strata has decided to sunset wumbo

Today we're sad to announce that, after multiple conversations and contemplating amongst the team, we have decided its time to sunset wumbo.
Wumbo was our first foray into building on Solana and we learned alot.
Unfortunately, we have not seen the type of adoption that we would like to see, whether it be from the creator/influencer side of things, or from the open source community.
We believe that there will be a future where social tokens will be an integral part of our day to day life, but dont think that time is now.

There were multiple other things that went into consideration when coming to this decision, below are the main reasons.

### Current Market Sentiment

### Burnout

As of this post all curves throughout the [OPEN Collective](https://blog.strataprotocol.com/open-collective) and Wumbo social tokens have been modified to a flat curve in order to allow users to recoup as much SOL as possible. Thanks for giving Wumbo a try. Our team greatly appreciated you and your early support!

If you'd like to exit all your Wumbo/OPEN positions back to SOL, you can use the button below:

import { CloseOutWumbo } from "@site/src/components/CloseOutWumbo";
