# Strata has decided to sunset wumbo

Today we're sad to announce that the Strata team has decided its time to sunset wumbo. As of this post
all curves throughout the [OPEN Collective](https://blog.strataprotocol.com/open-collective) have been modified to flat in order to allow users to recoup as much SOL as possible.

If you'd like to exit all your Wumbo/OPEN positions back to SOL, you can use the button below:

import { CloseOutWumbo } from "@site/src/components/CloseOutWumbo";

<CloseOutWumbo />
