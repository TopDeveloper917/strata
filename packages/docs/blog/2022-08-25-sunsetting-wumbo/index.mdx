# Strata has decided to sunset wumbo

Today we're sad to announce that the Strata team has decided its time to sunset wumbo. Wumbo was our first foray into building on Solana. We learned alot about the community and what it takes for social tokens to be successful. Unfortunately, we have not seen the type of adoption that we would like to see, whether it be from the creator/influencer side of things, or from the open source community. We believe that there will be a future where social tokens will be an integral part of our day to day life, but dont think that time is now.

As of this post all curves throughout the [OPEN Collective](https://blog.strataprotocol.com/open-collective) and Wumbo social tokens have been modified to a flat curve in order to allow users to recoup as much SOL as possible. Thanks for giving Wumbo a try. Our team greatly appreciated you and your early support!

If you'd like to exit all your Wumbo/OPEN positions back to SOL, you can use the button below:

import { CloseOutWumbo } from "@site/src/components/CloseOutWumbo";

<CloseOutWumbo />
