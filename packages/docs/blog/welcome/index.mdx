Strata is bridging the divide between individuals and community by providing powerful shared incentive structures. Strata is going to fuel the next wave of innovation in the Creator Economy.

Built on [Solana](https://solana.com/), Strata is the fastest and least expensive way to create, manage, and build economies of Social Tokens.

## What's a Social Token?

Let’s start first with the definition of a Token:

  > A token is an object that represents something else, such as another object (either physical or virtual).

Tokens are easy to move around, track ownership, and impossible to fake. We can represent anything with a token, which allows people to freely move ownership in a convenient way. 

A Social Token is a Token that belongs to an individual. It allows you to create, monetize, and drive value to your own token.

## Succeed Together

What if the value of your token was not just from your own efforts, but was also built on a community?
You're stronger with your friends. A group of people can pool resources and bring about innovation on a larger scale.

So how do we do that? At the heart of Strata are [Bonding Curves](/docs/learn/bonding_curves) that allow free and instant trading of a token without the need for an exchange or liquidity provider. 
Because of this Automated Market Maker (AMM), your token's value is directly tied to that of a base token's value. That base token is your *Collective*. Price your token in SOL, and your succss is bound to SOLs success, and SOLs success is yours.

:::info Collective
A Collective is a group of Social Tokens bound to the same base token. This means that every Social Token owner is incentive aligned to increase not just the value of their token, but the value/utility of the Collective
:::

Imagine a group of artists forming a collective for their genre, pooling resources to create a custom marketplace.
Imagine a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a token, and a collective of contributors with tokens bound to the DAO token.
Imagine the ability to bootstrap an entire economy around an idea.

## From Creator Economy to Collective Economy

Strata isn't just about creating a new monetization layer for creators. Our mission is to see what we can all accomplish together. 

### Free and Open

The key to innovation is rapid iteration and exploration. We believe that taking a cut will stifle innovation. As such, Strata is completely free to use and Open Source. The smart contracts take no share of the tokens exchanged. Strata will eventually form a DAO to govern the smart contracts and any on-chain state.

The goal is for Strata to become a standard, similar to [Metaplex](https://metaplex.com/) for social tokens and bonding curves.

### Flexibility with Sane Defaults

The most creative business models have yet to be discovered.
As such, the protocol remains as non opinionated and flexible as possible. 

Powerful customization is at your fingertips, allowing you to create new and innovative business models. 
From a large degree of freedom in bonding curve customization to the ability to tie social tokens to virtually anything;
Strata is truly your canvas. You can customize everything from your curve's shape to its launch-time characteristics, to the royalties you collect.

This might sound complicated, but with sane defaults you don't have to reach under the hood. Don't believe us? Create a social token on devnet _right now_

```jsx async name=create_social
var { mint } = await tokenCollectiveSdk.createSocialToken({
  ignoreIfExists: true, // If a Social Token already exists for this wallet, ignore.
  metadata: {
    name: "The I Love Strata Token",
    symbol: "luvSTRAT",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/jWSsJW6/logo.png",
    // Because this is dev, we need to provide the metaplex dev upload file url
    uploadUrl: "https://us-central1-principal-lane-200702.cloudfunctions.net/uploadFile2"
  },
  tokenBondingParams: {
    buyBaseRoyaltyPercentage: 0,
    buyTargetRoyaltyPercentage: 10,
    sellBaseRoyaltyPercentage: 0,
    sellTargetRoyaltyPercentage: 0
  }
});
```
Now display it in React!
```jsx live
 function TokenDisplay() {
   const { mint } = useVariables(); // Getting mint from above
   const { image, metadata, loading: metaLoading } = useTokenMetadata(mint);
   if (metaLoading) {
     return <div>Loading...</div>
   }

   return <div>
    <img style={{ width: "50px", height: "50px" }} src={image} />
    { metadata && <div>
      <div><b>{metadata.data.name}</b></div>
      <div>{metadata.data.symbol}</div>
    </div> }
   </div>
 }
```
