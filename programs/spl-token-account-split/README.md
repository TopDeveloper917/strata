# Spl Token Account Split

An approximate account fanout by allowing users to exchange staking reward tokens for a share of the account based on the total theoretical supply of staking tokens.

Note that this isn't an exact split, as you could perform the exchange _before_ a large influx of tokens into the account and lose out.

This contract is not in active use. If you would like the team to deploy it, please contact us.
